			Now you may be thinking;</br>
			"Why do I need to buy a proper violin? Can't I just rip some hair off a horse and start rubbing it against a tree branch? Isn't it basically the same thing?"</br> 
			And the short answer is yes, you can. But then the violin companies go out of business and that's just not very nice, is it? So just be cool, buy a proper one, and everybody can be happy.

			At the bottom of the page are included some useful links to good online violin shops, but the best way to buy a violin is at your local music shop.
			Buying a violin in person lets you test the weight, sound quality, and general feel of the instrument, something that just isn't possible online. 
			However if, like me, a crippling sense of social anxiety prevents you from even looking out the window without breaking into a cold sweat, the 
			links below may be helpful to you.
