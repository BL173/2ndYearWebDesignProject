			<b>Violin Basics:</b></br>
			A violin is a four stringed wooden instrument with a bow made of horsehair which is pulled across the strings to create music. It's incredibly cool (remember that, it <em>will</em> be on the test).
			Violins have been around for hundreds of years, and unfortunately it usually takes close to that time to learn how to play one. However, with my patented technique, you'll be able to go from a 
			Salieri to a full blown Mozart faster than you can say "Do you really have a patent?"

			And what is this magical technique I hear you ask? Well, isn't it obvious? YouTube videos! Yes that's right, I don't know anything about teaching myself, but I found at least one YouTube video
			promising to teach you how to play in under an hour so it must be at least possible. I mean, I haven't watched it yet but I read the title and it seemed very promising.
